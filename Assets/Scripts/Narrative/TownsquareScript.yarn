<<declare $reputation = 10>>
Narrator:Booted heels and walking sticks clatter noisily upon the ground adding to the cacophony in town. 
Narrator:As nightfall readily approached, the soul of Point Ecrin was beginning to transform from bustling commerce to quieter pursuits of the evening.
Narrator:Few souls loomed by their shops as they shuttered for the eventide, but one lone figure advancing from the docks Nisaea glimpsed, caught her attention. 
Narrator:A man clad in sea soaked work overalls redolent of kelp and brine, materialized much to Nisaea's pleasure. He seems like he's in a hurry.
